How I can load my own firmware?
----
The firmware must be placed on the `Instruction_Memory.vhd` file. The format is: Four hexadecimal tuples to describe one assembly instruction.

So, the instruction

`addi $s1, $0, 6` is 

`x"20",x"11",x"00",x"06",`.

I strongly recommend to use [MARS] software to export your code in hexadecimal format.

Remember: The Instruction Memory is an array with 512 elements. Each instruction is composed by four hexadecimal tuples. So the maximum number of instructions allowed is: `512/4 = 128 instructions`. You can modify this value according to the size of the FPGA memory.

### Example

For example, if you want to implement an unit than can multiply `6x4`, you can write the code in assembler language, like this:
```asm
# Set operands. In this example, multiplies 6x4
# So, in fact, this algorithm sums 6 times 4
addi $s1, $0, 6
addi $s2, $0, 4
# Set counters
addi $s0, $0, 0
addi $s3, $0, 0
for:
beq $s0, $s1, continue
  add $s3, $s3, $s2
  addi $s0, $s0, 1
  j for
continue:
# The result is stored in $s3 memory position
```
Then export it in hexadecimal code and write in the required mode:

```hexadecimal
x"20",x"11",x"00",x"06",
x"20",x"12",x"00",x"04",
x"20",x"10",x"00",x"00",
x"20",x"13",x"00",x"00",
x"12",x"11",x"00",x"03",
x"02",x"72",x"98",x"20",
x"22",x"10",x"00",x"01",
x"08",x"00",x"00",x"04",
```

**NOTE!** If you use MARS software, watch out all the *jump* instructions. The software **always** export the line like
`x"08",x"10"` when the second tuple **MUST** be `x"00"`.
So, always replace in the text `x"08",x"10"` by `x"08",x"00"`.
Otherwise the jump on this MIPS implementation will don't work.

Another notice: The `Data Memory` module is not implemented here with the rest of the microarchitecture. This is because I prefer to implement it as another module outside the processor (as a memory block, FIFO buffer, UART or another component). This is the reason of `address`, `readdata`, `writedata` and `memwrite` ports.
